# Analytical Network Input File

# Switch Topology with 32 NPUs
# All NPUs are connected to a central switch
# This represents a star topology where all nodes communicate through the switch

# Switch Topology
topology: [ Switch ]  # Ring, Switch, FullyConnected

# 32 NPUs connected to switch
npus_count: [ 32 ]  # number of NPUs

# Bandwidth per each link (per direction)
# Note: ASTRA-sim analytical backend doubles latency for switch, so actual latency = 2x specified
bandwidth: [ 400.0 ]  # GB/s

# Latency per each link
# Because ASTRA-sim analytical doubles switch latency, specify half the desired link latency
# Desired link latency: 500 ns, so specify 250 ns here
latency: [ 250.0 ]  # ns (actual link latency will be 2x = 500 ns)
