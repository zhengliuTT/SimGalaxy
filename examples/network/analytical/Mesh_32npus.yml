# 2D Mesh Topology with 32 NPUs (4x8 mesh)
# A mesh is implemented as Ring topology in both dimensions
# This creates a 4x8 grid where each node connects to its neighbors

# Mesh Topology (Ring in both dimensions)
topology: [ Ring, Ring ]  # Ring, Switch, FullyConnected

# 32 NPUs arranged as 4x8 mesh
npus_count: [ 4, 8 ]  # number of NPUs per dimension (4 x 8 = 32)

# Bandwidth per each dimension (per direction)
bandwidth: [ 400.0, 400.0 ]  # GB/s

# Latency per each dimension
latency: [ 250.0, 250.0 ]  # ns
